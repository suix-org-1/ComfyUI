## Multi-Speaker Text Format

For multi-speaker generation, format your text using the `[N]:` notation:

```
[1]: Hello, how are you today?
[2]: I'm doing great, thanks for asking!
[1]: That's wonderful to hear.
[3]: Hey everyone, mind if I join the conversation?
[2]: Not at all, welcome!
```

**Important Notes:**
- Use `[1]:`, `[2]:`, `[3]:`, `[4]:` for speaker labels
- Maximum 4 speakers supported
- The system automatically detects the number of speakers from your text
- Each speaker can have an optional voice sample for cloning

## Generation Modes

### Deterministic Mode (Default)
- `use_sampling = False`
- Produces consistent, stable output
- Recommended for production use

### Sampling Mode
- `use_sampling = True`
- More variation in output
- Uses temperature and top_p parameters
- Good for creative exploration

## Voice Cloning

To clone a voice:
1. Connect an audio node to the `voice_to_clone` input (single speaker)
2. Or connect to `speaker1_voice`, `speaker2_voice`, etc. (multi-speaker)
3. The model will attempt to match the voice characteristics

**Requirements for voice samples:**
- Clear audio with minimal background noise
- Minimum 3–10 seconds. Recommended at least 30 seconds for better quality
- Automatically resampled to 24kHz

## Pause Tags Support

### Overview
The VibeVoice wrapper includes a custom pause tag feature that allows you to insert silences between text segments. **This is NOT a standard Microsoft VibeVoice feature** - it's an original implementation of our wrapper to provide more control over speech pacing.

**Available from version 1.3.0**

### Usage
You can use two types of pause tags in your text:
- `[pause]` - Inserts a 1-second silence (default)
- `[pause:ms]` - Inserts a custom duration silence in milliseconds (e.g., `[pause:2000]` for 2 seconds)

### Examples

#### Single Speaker
```
Welcome to our presentation. [pause] Today we'll explore artificial intelligence. [pause:500] Let's begin!
```

#### Multi-Speaker  
```
[1]: Hello everyone [pause] how are you doing today?
[2]: I'm doing great! [pause:500] Thanks for asking.
[1]: Wonderful to hear!
```

### Important Notes

⚠️ **Context Limitation Warning**:
> **Note: The pause forces the text to be split into chunks. This may worsen the model's ability to understand the context. The model's context is represented ONLY by its own chunk.**

This means:
- Text before a pause and text after a pause are processed separately
- The model cannot see across pause boundaries when generating speech
- This may affect prosody and intonation consistency
- Use pauses sparingly for best results

### How It Works
1. The wrapper parses your text to find pause tags
2. Text segments between pauses are processed independently 
3. Silence audio is generated for each pause duration
4. All audio segments (speech and silence) are concatenated

### Best Practices
- Use pauses at natural breaking points (end of sentences, paragraphs)
- Avoid pauses in the middle of phrases where context is important
- Test different pause durations to find what sounds most natural

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Text Preparation**:
   - Use proper punctuation for natural pauses
   - Break long texts into paragraphs
   - For multi-speaker, ensure clear speaker transitions
   - Use pause tags sparingly to maintain context continuity

2. **Model Selection**:
   - Use 1.5B for quick single-speaker tasks (fastest, ~8GB VRAM)
   - Use Large for best quality and multi-speaker (~16GB VRAM)
   - Use Large-Quant-4Bit for good quality and low VRAM usage (~7GB VRAM)

3. **Seed Management**:
   - Default seed (42) works well for most cases
   - Save good seeds for consistent character voices
   - Try random seeds if default doesn't work well

4. **Performance**:
   - First run downloads models (5-17GB)
   - Subsequent runs use cached models
   - GPU recommended for faster inference

## System Requirements

### Hardware
- **Minimum**: 8GB VRAM for VibeVoice-1.5B
- **Recommended**: 17GB+ VRAM for VibeVoice-Large
- **RAM**: 16GB+ system memory

### Software
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- CUDA 11.8+ (for GPU acceleration)
- Transformers 4.51.3+
- ComfyUI (latest version)

## Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues
- Ensure you're using ComfyUI's Python environment
- Try manual installation if automatic fails
- Restart ComfyUI after installation

### Generation Issues
- If voices sound unstable, try deterministic mode
- For multi-speaker, ensure text has proper `[N]:` format
- Check that speaker numbers are sequential (1,2,3 not 1,3,5)

### Memory Issues
- Large model requires ~16GB VRAM
- Use 1.5B model for lower VRAM systems
- Models use bfloat16 precision for efficiency

## Examples

### Single Speaker
```
Text: "Welcome to our presentation. Today we'll explore the fascinating world of artificial intelligence."
Model: VibeVoice-1.5B
cfg_scale: 1.3
use_sampling: False
```

### Two Speakers
```
[1]: Have you seen the new AI developments?
[2]: Yes, they're quite impressive!
[1]: I think voice synthesis has come a long way.
[2]: Absolutely, it sounds so natural now.
```

### Four Speaker Conversation
```
[1]: Welcome everyone to our meeting.
[2]: Thanks for having us!
[3]: Glad to be here.
[4]: Looking forward to the discussion.
[1]: Let's begin with the agenda.
```
